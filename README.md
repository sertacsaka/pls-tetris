## Tetris game coded in PL/SQL

A couple of years ago, when I was looking at the TOAD screen that I was face to face almost every day, I said, is it possible to program a game with PL/SQL?

Although it was a bit of a pain to play because I couldn't provide a closed loop that accepts user input from the editor screen, all in all it is an interesting study.
